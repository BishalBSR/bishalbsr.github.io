	<h2>INSTINCTIVE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
	<p class="list">Some of the most technologically advanced features in the market:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Full-LED lighting system</li>
		<li>Hybrid aluminum/carbon fiber chassis</li>
		<li>Lamborghini Doppia Frizione (LDF) dual clutch gearbox</li>
		<li>Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (LDS)</li>
		<li>Magneto-rheologic suspension</li>
		<li>Electronically controlled all-wheel drive system</li>
		<li>Naturally aspirated V10 engine</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>FULL LED LIGHTING CONCEPT</h2> <img src="../images/huracán_led_lighting.jpg" alt="Picture of the Huracán's LED Lighting" height="200" width="300"/>
	<p>For an unmistakably recognizable night design and a high tech appearance, the new Huracán includes a full LED lighting system. Every light, including double-Y daytime running lights, headlamps, rear lamps, license plate lamps and interior lights is LED. The LED light is very similar to the daylight and ensures more contrast by night and a reduced fatigue effect for the eyes for the driver.</p>
	
	<h2>INCREASED EFFICIENCY</h2>
	<p>The standard steering is an advanced Electromechanical Power Steering (EPS) system. It ensures an increased efficiency and was carefully set up in order to provide the driver with the perfect steering feedback according to the driving situation.</p>
	
	<h2>MAGNETO-RHEOLOGIC SUSPENSION</h2>
	<p>The D11 is an adaptive damper system. The dampers are magnetically controlled: a special - magneto-rheological - fluid is used in order to change the damping characteristics of the suspension in milliseconds. The Huracán ensures with the magneto-rheological suspension both, the highest driving precision and performance, as well as day-to-day usability.</p>
	
	<h2>ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED ALL WHEEL DRIVE</h2>
	<p>The all-wheel drive system is electronically controlled and therefore faster and extremely precise in transferring the torque between axles, according to the road situation and the dynamic modes selected. The new all-wheel drive system was developed with the first target to increase the performance potential of the Huracán and, at the same time, traction and safety on wet or uneven roads.</p>
	
	<h2>PARKING ASSISTANCE</h2> <img src="../images/huracán_parking_assistance.jpg" alt="Picture of the Huracán's Parking Assistance in the front and rear of the car" height="200" width="300"/>
	<p>On the Lamborghini Huracán two options are available for parking assistance:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>front and rear sensors</li>
		<li>front and rear sensors and rear view camera</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>INTERIOR CONCEPTS</h2> <img src="../images/huracán_interior.jpg" alt="Picture of the Huracán's interior design" height="200" width="300"/>
	<ul>
		<li><strong><div  class="list">UNICOLOR FULL LEATHER:</div></strong> Most of the cockpit is upholstered in fine nappa leather.</li>
		<li><strong><div  class="list">UNICOLOR SPORTIVO ALCANTARA:</div></strong> With this package the following parts are upholstered in Alcantara: roof lining, A-pillars, lower dashboard, door panels inner trim, seat centers, center console upper/lower sides, lid of storage bin and defroster trim.</li>
		<li><strong><div  class="list">BICOLOR SPORTIVO ALCANTARA:</div></strong> This combination includes the same parts in Alcantara of UNICOLOR SPORTIVO ALCANTARA, with a contrasting color for the following parts: lower dashboard, door panels inner trim lower part, seat centers, center console lower sides and lid of storage bin.</li>
		<li><strong><div  class="list">BICOLOR SPORTIVO LEATHER:</div></strong> This package has the same color combination as the Bicolor Sportivo Alcantara, but the contrast colors are upholstered in fine nappa leather.</li>
		<li><strong><div  class="list">BICOLOR ELEGANTE LEATHER:</div></strong> Nine different dedicated contrasting colors are available. Lower dashboard, door panel inner trim, seat center, center console, center console sides and lower part are presented in the choosen contrast color.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>ELECTRO-MECHANICAL POWER STEERING</h2>
	<p>Along with the standard electro-mechanical power steering, the optional Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (LDS) is also changing the steering ratio, going from very direct (race-like feeling) to more indirect for a comfortable and stable driving.</p>
