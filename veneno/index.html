	<h2>THE SYSTEMATIC, CARBON-FIBER, LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN</h2>
	<p>With a dry weight of just 1,490 kilograms (3,278 pounds), the Veneno Roadster benefits from a power-to-weight ratio of just 1.99 kg/hp (4.38 lbs/hp) which guarantees a performance that is nothing short of mind-blowing.</p>
	
	<h2>THE AERODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY OF A RACING PROTOTYPE</h2>
	<p>The Veneno Roadster accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.9 seconds and top speed stands at 355 km/h. The car is driven by a twelve-cylinder engine with a displacement of 6.5 liters and is equipped with the extremely fast-shifting ISR transmission with five modes.</p>
	
	<h2>A COLLECTOR'S MASTERPIECE OF ENGINEERING AND DESIGN</h2>
	<p>An open racing prototype with an extreme design and breathtaking performance. And it is one of the world’s most exclusive automobiles: not more than nine units will be built during the course of 2014.</p>
	
	<h2>CARBON FIBER DOMINATES ALSO THE INTERIOR</h2> <img src="../images/veneno_roadster_interior.jpg" alt="Picture of the Veneno Roadster's interior design" height="200" width="300"/>
	<p>The carbon fiber monocoque is visible inside the car around the central tunnel and the sills. The two lightweight bucket seats are made from Lamborghini’s patented Forged Composite. The woven carbon-fiber CarbonSkin is used to clad the entire cockpit, part of the seats and the headliner.</p>
