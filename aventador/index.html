	<h2>NO COMPETITION</h2>
	<p>The new Aventador LP 700-4 Roadster boasts record performance. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in only 3 seconds flat and has a maximum speed of some 350 km/h. These numbers, combined with a drive train featuring a centrally located, 6.5 liter aspirated V12 generating 700 hp, an ISR 7-speed gearbox and push-rod suspension make the new Aventador Roadster a unique super sports car with no direct competition.</p>
	
	<h2>STYLISH ELEGANCE</h2>
	<p>The range of colors has been supplemented with a very light, metallic blue color, Azzuro Thetis, whose tone varies with the angle of the light and recalls the shade of the extraordinarily beautiful 1968 Miura Roadster. The new Aventador LP 700-4 Roadster also features new Dione 20"/21" rims with a daring, aggressive look.</p>
	
	<h2>THE POWER AND THE BEAUTY</h2>
	<p>The engine hood on the Roadster differs from the hood on the coupé because of its central "spinal column" with two pairs of hexagonal windows connected at the sides as if they were hyper-tech armor plates. Their purpose is to cool the engine, drain off rain water properly and, of course, allow the beauty of the V12 power unit to be admired.</p>
	
	<h2>MADE IN SANT'AGATA BOLOGNESE</h2> <img src="../images/aventador_roadster_interior.jpg" alt="Picture of the Aventador Roadster's interior design" height="200" width="300"/>
	<p>Even the interior has a new look. The use of leather called Sabbia Nefertem highlights the superb hand-made craftsmanship of the upholstery from Sant'Agata Bolognese.</p>
	
	<h2>SPORTINESS AND ELEGANCE</h2>
	<p>The new Aventador LP 700-4 Roadster is a completely open vehicle with sleek lines combining perfectly balanced sportiness and elegance. The design is the result of a careful study into the best way of combining performance, elegant style, ease of use and a driving experience that excites all five senses.</p>
